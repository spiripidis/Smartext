i re build the project in Visual Code, i had to install this libriries in order for it to work using "pip install [libriry name]" and also i added the icons folder in the project
as long as you follow the steps of adding the libriries and the icons in the folder( i already added them) and run the smartext.py you will see the project complete and you are
free to build it and tinker with it


import libriries:
pillow
nltk
pyAesCrypt
opencv-python
pytesseract
wikipedia
editdistance
tensorflow
tk (tkinter for the ui)
